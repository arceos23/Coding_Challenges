# Coding Challenges

[Coding Challenges](https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/intro) is a series of coding challenges created by [John Crickett](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johncrickett/).

# Description

These coding challenges help software engineers develop their skills through deliberate practice. Each challenge involves implementing a full application or tool. The challenges are small enough to complete in one's spare time over one or two weeks. Yet, the challenges are large enough to be complete working projects.
